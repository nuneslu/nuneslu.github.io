Hi, I'm Lucas Nunes! I'm a Ph.D. student at University of Bonn in Germany, supervised by Prof. Dr. Cyrill Stachniss. I did my Master's at University of SÃ£o Paulo in Brazil where I was born. Besides a researcher, I'm an photography enthusiast and like to play video games.

My research interest lies in Generative Models and Representation Learning for large-scale 3D data in autonomous driving context (but not only).

- **Representation Learning**: My research in the field is related to unsupervised representation learning from unlabeled data in the context of autonomous driving.
    - [SegContrast](https://github.com/PRBonn/segcontrast): SegContrast: 3D Point Cloud Feature Representation Learning through Self-supervised Segment Discrimination
    - [TARL](https://github.com/PRBonn/TARL): Temporal Consistent 3D LiDAR Representation Learning for Semantic Perception in Autonomous Driving
    - [3DUIS](https://github.com/PRBonn/3DUIS): Unsupervised Class-Agnostic Instance Segmentation of 3D LiDAR Data for Autonomous Vehicles

- **Generative Models**: I have started working with generative models during my master's. Currently, my research in the field is in the area of 3D semantic scene-scale data generation.

- Besides the main projects that I have worked during my Ph.D. listed above, I have also collaborated on other projects with open-sourced code listed below:

    - [Mask4D](https://github.com/PRBonn/Mask4D): End-to-End Mask-Based 4D Panoptic Segmentation for LiDAR Sequences
    - [MaskPLS](https://github.com/PRBonn/MaskPLS): Mask-Based Panoptic LiDAR Segmentation for Autonomous Driving
    - [KPPR](https://github.com/PRBonn/kppr): Exploiting Momentum Contrast for Point Cloud-Based Place Recognition
    - [4DMOS](https://github.com/PRBonn/4DMOS): Receding Moving Object Segmentation in 3D LiDAR Data Using Sparse 4D Convolutions
    - [Auto-MOS](https://github.com/PRBonn/auto-mos): Automatic Labeling to Generate Training Data for Online LiDAR-based Moving Object Segmentation
