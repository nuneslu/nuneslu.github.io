Hi, I'm Lucas Nunes! I'm a Ph.D. student at University of Bonn in Germany, supervised by Prof. Dr. Cyrill Stachniss. I did my Master's at University of SÃ£o Paulo in Brazil where I was born. Besides a researcher, I'm an photography enthusiast and like to play video games.

My research interest lies in Generative Models and Representation Learning for large-scale 3D data.

- Representation Learning: My research in the field is related to unsupervised representation learning from unlabeled data in the context of autonomous driving.

- Generative Models: I have started working with generative models during my master's. Currently, my research is the field is in the area of semantic scene-scale data generation.
